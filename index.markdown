 Hello! I'm **Manasa Hariharan**. 

 I'm a Data Scientist working in the intersection between Healthcare and Human Resources. I graduated from UIUC with a Master's in Statistics in 2019. I like working on projects that combine my interests outside of work and my desire to learn and practice new languages and algorithms. Some of my more interesting projects include an attempt to map and cluster all the genre tags on spotify and using twitter to predict overall sentiment towards the 2 main candidates in the 2016 US Election.

You can find my resume [here](/Resume_Manasa_2020.pdf/)
